                        Plastic pollution involves the accumulation of plastic products in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size.The prominence of plastic pollution is correlated with plastics being inexpensive and durable, which lends to high levels of plastics used by humans.However, it is slow to degrade.Plastic pollution can unfavourably affect lands, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can also be affected through entanglement, direct ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that cause interruptions in biological functions.Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through the disruption of the thyroid hormone axis or hormone levels.In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which an estimated mere 24% makes it into recycling systems.That leaves a remaining 3.8 million tonnes of waste, destined for landfills.Plastic reduction efforts have occurred in some areas in attempts to reduce plastic consumption and pollution and promote plastic recycling.
