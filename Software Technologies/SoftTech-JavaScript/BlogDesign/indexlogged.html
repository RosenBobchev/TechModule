                        Plastic pollution involves the accumulation of plastic products in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size.The prominence of plastic pollution is correlated with plastics being inexpensive and durable, which lends to high levels of plastics used by humans.However, it is slow to degrade.Plastic pollution can unfavourably affect lands, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can also be affected through entanglement, direct ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that cause interruptions in biological functions.Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through the disruption of the thyroid hormone axis or hormone levels.In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which an estimated mere 24% makes it into recycling systems.That leaves a remaining 3.8 million tonnes of waste, destined for landfills.Plastic reduction efforts have occurred in some areas in attempts to reduce plastic consumption and pollution and promote plastic recycling.

                        In 2012, it was estimated that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans.One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is nurdles.Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of microplastic) used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via cargo ship.Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and it has been estimated that globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles.Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely.In the process, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and polystyrene can leach into waters from some plastics.Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans, and combined with plastic bags and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris.One study estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small microplastics, large microplastics, meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.The litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life, and humans.The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate, which is a toxic carcinogen, as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.Plankton, fish, and ultimately the human race, through the food chain, ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. Consuming the fish that contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer, immune disorders, and birth defects.The majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics. According to Dr. Marcus Eriksen of The 5 Gyres Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016).This plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as ocean gyres.The majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.

                        The distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean currents, coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes.Human population in certain areas also plays a large role in this. Plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the Caribbean.It serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments.This could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse.Plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.
