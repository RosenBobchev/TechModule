                        In 2012, it was estimated that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans.One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is nurdles.Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of microplastic) used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via cargo ship.Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and it has been estimated that globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles.Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely.In the process, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and polystyrene can leach into waters from some plastics.Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans, and combined with plastic bags and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris.One study estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small microplastics, large microplastics, meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.The litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life, and humans.The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate, which is a toxic carcinogen, as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.Plankton, fish, and ultimately the human race, through the food chain, ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. Consuming the fish that contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer, immune disorders, and birth defects.The majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics. According to Dr. Marcus Eriksen of The 5 Gyres Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016).This plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as ocean gyres.The majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.
